            I am a self-taught game developer, as it is something that I am very passionate about.
            The items listed below are non-exhaustive. I have cancelled many projects due to me not deeming them fun enough, 
            marketable enough, or due to other aspects I dislike about them.

        <button class="collapsible"> Codename Project Dark</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Project Dark is a long term project that I am working on. 
                Explore a haunted randomly generated mansion and collect treasure along the way.
                The images below are early prototype images, the artwork is not finalized and I plan on paying
                artists to do pixel art. However, many systems are implemented, and I think they are impressive.
            </p>

                I designed and implemented an expandable "Tetris" inventory, where treasure has to be rotated to fit within your slots.
                It works with any shape imagineable. There are also item interactions, such as breaking vases to see if there are coins
                within, and item-item interactions (similar to crafting).
            </p>

            <p>
                I designed an implemented a random level generator that has some of the coolest
                looking layouts I have ever seen. The level is divided into randomly sized chunks which make up rooms. Chunks can 
                also be connected to eachother to create unique room shapes. Rooms can be different types such as hallways, gardens,
                kitchens, libraries, and more. Additionally, the individual rooms have their own generation, they can be any shape
                such as circles, or even more crazy shapes (I only show square rooms here).

                Example of a basic library room. Again, all artwork is placeholder.

                I have been building the game by creating, having playtesters feedback, fixing, and repeating that cycle. 
                Currently, it is in an amazing spot and most playtesters like the game.
                Additionally I have taken many steps to make it
                marketable and hopefully go viral. However, because I have never made a game before I'm putting this on hold
                until I finish "Dash For Your Life", which is extremely marketable based on my Geometry Dash community connections.

                Dash For Your Life is an autoscroller platformer "horror" game based on the popular title "Geometry Dash", where you
                dash through levels and have to solve miniature puzzles and remove distracting enemies to beat levels. It will be released
                on PC, Android, and IOS and is a "simple" project compared to Project Dark.

            <p>
                While less technically impressive, this game is extremely marketable, tapping into the Geometry Dash community and
                hopefully expanding into the child-freindly horror communities which are both very large, and hence is my primary focus right 
                now. Additionally, as the game 
                is mobile-freindly this makes it have an even wider audience. I have been using a set of playtesters from different communities to 
                make sure the game is playable and enjoyable at many skill levels, which is extremely important for mobile games.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I have developed a one-versus-one trading card game and have playtested it extensively. Because physical products cost a lot
                to produce, this is put on hold until I get enough capital to pursue it. There are also some design issues I am not happy with
                right now, as I feel the game is similar to chess right now and lacks turn-to-turn excitement that other games like
                Marvel Snap or Balatro has. These issues have to
                be addressed before I launch the game, and will decide if it ever gets launched. I am also trying to solidify some of the 
                balancing issues that exist for "new" cards that would come from card packs, ensuring that there is room for new cards without
                removing the usefulness of older ones. I really want to make a physical product, and a card game is the most feasable.
