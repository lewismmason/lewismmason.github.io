        <p>I am a self-taught game developer, driven by my passion for games and having fun! The projects listed below are just a few examples of what I've worked on. However, I've canceled several others because I didn't find them fun enough, marketable enough, or because of other aspects that I didn't enjoy!

        <button class="collapsible"> Codename Project Dark</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Project Dark is a long-term project that I'm currently working on. The game lets you explore a haunted, randomly generated mansion while collecting treasure along the way. The images below show early prototypes; the artwork is not finalized, and I plan to hire artists to create pixel art. However, many core systems are already implemented, and I'm quite proud of the progress made so far.
            </p>

                I designed and implemented an expandable "Tetris"-style inventory system, where treasures must be rotated to fit into available slots. It supports any shape imaginable. Additionally, I incorporated item interactions, such as breaking vases to reveal hidden coins, as well as item-to-item interactions (similar to crafting).
            </p>

            <p>
                I designed and implemented a random level generator that produces some of the most visually interesting layouts I've ever seen. The level is divided into randomly sized chunks, which form the rooms. These chunks can be connected to create unique room shapes. Rooms can vary in type, including hallways, gardens, kitchens, libraries, and more. Additionally, each room has its own generation, allowing for various shapes, such as circles or even more unconventional forms (though I've only shown square rooms here).

            <p>
                I've been developing the game through a cycle of creation, playtester feedback, adjustments, and iteration. It's currently in a fantastic place, and most playtesters enjoy the game. I've also taken several steps to make it marketable and hope it gains traction. However, since this is my first game, I've decided to put it on hold for now to focus on Dash For Your Life, which is highly marketable due to my connections within the Geometry Dash community.

            <p>
                Dash For Your Life is an autoscroller platformer "horror" game inspired by the popular title Geometry Dash. In the game, players dash through levels, solving miniature puzzles and eliminating distracting enemies to progress. The version shown here is an early prototype, which has since been gutted and re-built based on community feedback. It will be released on PC, Android, and iOS, and is a "simpler" project compared to Project Dark.

            <p>
                While less technically complex, this game is highly marketable, tapping into the Geometry Dash community and potentially expanding into child-friendly horror communities, both of which are large and active. This makes Dash For Your Life my primary focus right now. Additionally, its mobile-friendly design broadens its potential audience. I've been using a diverse set of playtesters from various communities to ensure the game is enjoyable and accessible at different skill levels, which is crucial for mobile games.

            <p>
                I was a community level designer for the video game Geometry Dash. My levels have collectively received over 2.95 million downloads. If you know anyone who plays community levels, ask them if they've come across any of mine!

                <b>Night Rider:</b> 
                I organized and hosted a Cyberpunk/Blade Runner-themed collaboration with 40 creators. The level has been played over 575k times and, at the time of release, was considered one of the most visually stunning levels ever created.

                A solo project where you explore an ancient snake temple. It has been played over 358k times and features the first-ever randomized boss fight. I consider this my magnum opus.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I've developed a one-versus-one trading card game and have extensively playtested it. However, due to the high cost of producing physical products, the project is currently on hold until I can secure enough capital to pursue it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also some design issues I'm not happy with, as I feel the game is currently too similar to chess and lacks the turn-to-turn excitement found in games like Marvel Snap or Balatro. These issues need to be addressed before I can launch the game, and they will ultimately determine whether or not the game ever gets released.
